[OpenLeft]
So, the rumors were true.[CloseEyes][N]
My uncle[Beat] intends to really do this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I have no doubts, Lord Olmos.[N]
My reports leave little room for it.[A]
Lord Narvaez is building up his forces[N]
and intends to challenge your father openly.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Insanity.[N]
He has no chance of victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
If you think that true,[N]
we best act quickly.[A]
If Lord Narvaez builds momentum,[N]
gets the people on his side[Beat][A]
It will certainly make an extended[N]
civil conflict likely.[A]
[OpenLeft]
That would be ruinous.[N]
We cannot let that happen.[A]
But still[Beat] I feel uneasy.[N]
Is fighting really necessary?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Lord Olmos, did you not[N]
hear Volquez's report?[A]
Your uncle is openly challenging[N]
Baron Colome's authority.[A]
As his second son, this is[N]
also your authority, too.[A]
He would send you to the gallows[N]
if it meant taking power for himself.[A]
[OpenLeft]
It's a shame it's come to this.[N]
I am quite close with my cousins.[A]
I would only hope they can get[N]
my uncle to listen to reason[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Lord Narvaez is interested in power,[N]
and the trappings that come with it.[A]
According to him, your family has gotten[N]
a bit too fat with trade revenue.[A]
He claims he is poor despite some ports[N]
being part of his holdings.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Greedy fool.[N]
He doesn't know poverty.[A]
Baron Colome governs this territory[N]
fairly, making it prosperous for all.[A]
It is by his generosity that Lord Narvaez[N]
sits in his castle and earns his keep.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Keep your voice down, Flor.[N]
He has ears in these parts.[A]
Port Oliveira is a critical[N]
route for the coffee trade.[A]
A shipment is coming soon,[N]
and he intends to strike.[A]
[OpenLeft]
And so we must prepare to[N]
put this down before chaos can reign[Beat][A]

## Chapter_01_Opening_2
[LoadMidLeft][LoadZapatera]
Lord Olmos![N]
There's a disturbance outside.[A]
It looks like Lord Narvaez's[N]
troops are here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVolquez][OpenLeft][LoadOlmos][OpenFarLeft][LoadFlor]
[OpenMidRight]
Right on cue.[N]
Flor, I'll await your orders.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Lord Olmos is in command, Volquez.[N]
We will answer to him.[A]
I am here as his retainer.[N]
This is his first taste of battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I thought it strange Baron Colome[N]
would send his younger son[Beat][A]
Are you sure he's ready for command?[N]
These are not mere pirates.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat] Do you doubt Baron Colome's judgment?[N]
Lord Olmos is ready.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No[Beat] but I don't want this to[N]
become a festering wound.[A]
Now isn't the time for training.[N]
We must deliver a decisive blow![A]
It's bad enough he barely sent[N]
any soldiers, much less his young son![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Volquez! You speak too freely.[N]
Baron Colome sent what he felt was necessary.[A]
His decision is based on the contents[N]
of your report, after all.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I understand you may doubt me,[N]
but[Beat] I will do my best.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Heed me, Lord Olmos.[N]
I owe your father a great deal.[A]
Excuse my outburst[Beat][N]
I am yours to command.[A]

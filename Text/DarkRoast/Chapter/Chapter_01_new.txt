[OpenLeft][LoadOlmos][OpenFarLeft][LoadFlor][OpenMidRight][LoadVolquez]
[OpenLeft]
So, the rumors were true.[CloseEyes][N]
My uncle[Beat] intends to really do this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I have no doubts, Lord Olmos.[N]
My reports leave little room for it.[A]
Lord Narvaez is building up his forces[N]
and intends to challenge your father openly.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Insanity.[N]
He has no chance of victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
If you think that true,[N]
we best act quickly.[A]
If Lord Narvaez builds momentum,[N]
gets the people on his side[Beat][A]
It will certainly make an extended[N]
civil conflict likely.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Embroiling the Poblano territory[N]
in a civil conflict[Beat][A]
This would be bad.[N]
We cannot let that happen.[A]
But still[Beat] I feel uneasy.[N]
Is fighting really necessary?[A]
Surely my uncle will come to[N]
listen to reason[Beat] won't he?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Lord Olmos, did you not[N]
hear Volquez's report?[A]
Your uncle is openly challenging[N]
Baron Colome's authority.[A]
As his second son, this is[N]
also your authority, too.[A]
He would send you to the gallows[N]
if it meant taking power for himself.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Growing up I was quite close with[N]
my cousins[Beat] I can only hope[A]
that they help Lord Narvaez[N]
recognize that he's lost his way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Lord Narvaez is interested in power,[N]
and the trappings that come with it.[A]
According to him, your family has gotten[N]
a bit too fat with trade revenue.[A]
He claims he is poor despite some ports[N]
being part of his holdings.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Greedy fool.[N]
He doesn't know poverty.[A]
Baron Colome governs this territory[N]
fairly, making it prosperous for all.[A]
It is by his generosity that Lord Narvaez[N]
sits in his castle and earns his keep.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Keep your voice down, Flor.[N]
He has ears in these parts.[A]
Port Oliveira is a critical[N]
route for the coffee trade.[A]
A shipment is coming soon,[N]
and he intends to strike.[A]
[OpenLeft]
He'd go so far to disrupt[N]
the flow of coffee?[A]
This is the lifeblood of our[N]
territory, well, the entire island![A]

## Chapter_01_Opening_2
[LoadMidLeft][LoadZapatera]
Lord Olmos![N]
There's a disturbance outside.[A]
It looks like Lord Narvaez's[N]
troops are here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVolquez][OpenLeft][LoadOlmos][OpenFarLeft][LoadFlor]
[OpenMidRight]
Right on cue.[N]
Flor, I'll await your orders.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Lord Olmos is in command, Volquez.[N]
We will answer to him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I thought it strange Baron Colome[N]
would send his younger son[Beat][A]
Are you sure he's ready for command?[N]
These are not mere pirates.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat] Do you doubt Baron Colome's judgment?[N]
Lord Olmos is ready.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I know I am still young, Volquez[Beat][N]
but I recently completed by studies.[A]
I've learned a few things of tactics[N]
swordplay, and leadership.[A]
I hope that I can prove I am[N]
a worthy heir to my family name.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Very well.[N]
Use me as you see fit.[A][X]

## Chapter_01_NewUnitIntro
[LoadMidLeft][LoadNaranja][LoadMidRight][LoadArbolito]
[OpenMidLeft]
What's going on?[N]
Why are we under attack?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Not sure, but it looks like[N]
a conflict between noble factions.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm[Beat][N]
You thinking what I'm thinking?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Gold isn't easy to come by,[N]
perhaps we can make ourselves useful.[A]
The question is, which side?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, one group's trying to defend[N]
the port, I'd say that one.[A]
No one's going to fault us[N]
for protecting our homes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Maybe we can get a contract[N]
if we perform well.[A]
But I suppose first we have[N]
to survive, don't we?[A]
Alright, let's go.[A][X]

## Chapter_01_BossIntro
[LoadMidLeft][LoadGiannella]
Heed my words, citizens of Port Oliveira![N]
I am here by Lord Narvaez's will.[A]
We hereby claim this port in his name[N]
to counter Baron Colome's greed![A]
It is by the Baron's hand[N]
that the people suffer![A]
Coin flows into Poblano,[N]
but not to the people.[A]
Accept us as rightful rulers,[N]
and help us usher in a new era![A][X]

## Chapter_01_BossIntroReact
[LoadMidLeft][LoadOlmos][LoadRight][LoadFlor][LoadFarRight][LoadVolquez]
[MidLeft]
Are the people truly suffering[N]
as she claims?[A]
I've been away for some time,[N]
but I always thought[Beat][A]
[LoadFarRight]
Those who crave power will twist the[N]
truth to justify their selfish wishes.[A]
If Lord Narvaez truly cared as deeply[N]
for the welfare of Poblanans,[A]
he would not raise his sword[N]
within our borders.[A]
[LoadMidLeft]
Misguided they may be, they are[N]
still our people, are they not?[A]
[LoadRight]
Blood will be spilled here, Lord Olmos.[N]
If not theirs, then yours.[A]
To me, the choice is straightforward.[N]
We must stop them now.[A]
[LoadFarRight]
I understand your doubts,[N]
but this could fester like a wound.[A]
And that would lead to more[N]
bloodshed, more tragedy, more pain.[A]
You'd do well to nip rebellion[N]
in the bud, harsh as it may seem.[A]
A show of the Baron's might[N]
will make others think twice.[A]
[LoadRight]
Volquez speaks true.[N]
Lord Olmos, do not hesitate.[A]
[LoadMidLeft]
Ah[Beat] Forgive me.[N]
I will[Beat] I will fight.[A]
Forgive me for showing weakness.[N]
I shall not waver. I swear it![A][X]

## Chapter_01_Village_TealGem
[ConversationText]
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadOldMan]
[LoadMidLeft]
The people of Port Oliveira stand[N]
with Baron Colome![A]
Anything to disrupt the coffee[N]
trade must be stopped.[A]
Here, take these funds[N]
to stop this senseless violence![A][X]

## Chapter_01_Village_Longbow
[ConversationText]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCurrent][LoadMidLeft][LoadLittleGirl]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, so my older brother[N]
really likes bows.[A]
He wants to be a bowyer,[N]
you know, someone who makes bows.[A]
I don't think he has much talent[N]
for it, between you and me.[A]
He used to cook me these excellent[N]
meals with crustaceans from the river.[A]
You know, river crabs and whatnot.[N]
Steamed, a little bit of butter[Beat][A]
But no more.[N]
Now it's just all about bows.[A]
I can't stand it![N]
I've been slowly stealing them from him.[A]
You know, pawning them off.[N]
He thinks he's going crazy.[A]
He's even considering getting into[N]
cooking again, maybe getting formal training.[A]
You know how great that is for me?[N]
Anyway, this will be our secret.[A]
Here, this one is like a bow,[N]
but it is a little longer.[A]
Thanks for saving me a trip to the shop.[N]
Please don't tell on me![A][X]

## Chapter_01_Village_IronSword
[ConversationText]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCurrent][LoadMidLeft][StorchMom]
[OpenMidLeft]
My late husband was a mercenary.[N]
He perished fighting pirates.[A]
They lured him into a cave along[N]
the coast, their foul lair.[A]
His entire company, wiped out.[N]
I'll never forgive them.[A]
Here. This was his favorite sword.[N]
I now entrust it to you.[A]
I can only hope you use it[N]
in his memory[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter_01_Boss_Zapatera
[LoadMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadGiannella]
Zapatera[Beat][N]
You think you can best me?[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadFace][LoadZapatera]
Giannella[Beat][N]
Do you think this is right?[A]
You were the better soldier,[N]
and your rise through the ranks[A]
speaks to your skill[Beat][A]
But your judgment is poor.[N]
Don't you see this is wrong?[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadGiannella]
You are blind to the truth.[A]
Lord Narvaez wishes to make a[N]
more just society here in Poblano.[A]
For too long Baron Colome has reigned,[N]
and for too long he's eaten well,[A]
while the rest of us became gaunt.[N]
No more! Zapatera![A]
Stand down, man![A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadFace][LoadZapatera]
Giannella[Beat] Baron Colome gave[N]
me a chance at a better life.[A]
My family eats well.[N]
Is this suffering?[A]
Waging war will bring[N]
only deep sorrow.[A]
I'm sorry[Beat] Giannella[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter_01_Boss_Flor
[LoadMidRight][LoadFace][LoadFlor]
Tell your men to stand down.[N]
It's over.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadGiannella]
Putting down the people once more,[N]
Does Baron Colome have no sense?[A]
Lord Narvaez will bring forth[N]
a new era in Poblano![A]
A Poblano for Poblanans![A]
[Clear]
[LoeadMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadFlor]
Lord Narvaez would burn down[N]
pillars of our economy[A]
to put himself atop the rubble.[N]
That is greed.[A]
That is selfishness.[A]
The costs would be immense,[N]
and the benefits unclear.[A]
Unless you've convinced yourself[N]
your status, too, would rise?[A]
Your rhetoric may win over[N]
the gullible and the depraved,[A]
but it will not work on me.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadGiannella]
Speak no more![N]
It's clear where you stand.[A]
Allow me to end this.[N]
Draw your blade![A][X]

## Chapter_01_Boss_Olmos 
[LoadMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadGiannella]
Baron Colome's younger son?[N]
Lord Olmos! Do not resist.[A]
Your presence was not part[N]
of our plans[Beat][A]
But I will take you back with[N]
me as a bargaining chip.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadFace][LoadOlmos]
What does Lord Narvaez want?[N]
Why does he wage war in our home?[A]
[Cear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadGiannella]
I wouldn't expect the Baron's[N]
son to understand[Beat][A]
Look at your armor.[N]
Your blade. Your education.[A]
You have enviable opportunities,[N]
Lord Olmos. Many do not.[A]
Many toil in the sun and rain[N]
to grow crops they cannot eat.[A]
Lord Narvaez sees this as injustice,[N]
I think anyone would.[A]
Baron Colome keeps riches for himself,[N]
benefiting off their efforts.[A]
Do you not see the problem?[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadFace][LoadOlmos]
Is the situation truly so dire?[N]
I admit, I know little of the fields.[A]
But Baron Colome oversees the territory.[N]
He funds the army.[A]
He funds the trade.[N]
Do we not all benefit from this?[A]
Perhaps if we just talked[Beat][N]
Maybe then we could do something.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadGiannella]
Naive sentiments, Lord Olmos.[N]
I knew you'd never understand.[A]
Too blinded to know better.[N]
The time for talk has passed.[A]
It is time for us to cross[N]
blades. Come![A][X]

## Chapter_01_EndEvent_1
[OpenLeft][LoadOlmos][OpenFarLeft][LoadFlor][OpenMidRight][LoadVolquez]
The stragglers are retreating.[N]
We've won the day.[A]
Damage was minimal,[N]
and things are settling down.[A]
[OpenLeft]
That's all well and good[Beat][N]
But I cannot help but feel uneasy.[A]
Not just for raising my blade[N]
against my own people,[A]
but of the resentment in their hearts.[N]
Flor, Volquez[Beat][A]
Speak plainly to me.[N]
Are things truly so dire?[A]
Enough to do[Beat] this?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat] It's best you focus on what[N]
you can control, Lord Olmos.[A]
We should send a report to[N]
Baron Colome and await his instructions.[A]
[OpenLeft]
You'd send a messenger?[N]
Why not go back ourselves?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
If my intuition is correct,[N]
this is far from the last fight.[A]
We'd do well to press the attack[N]
before resentment further forments.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I will send a messenger at once.[N]
You both should rest.[A]
[OpenMidRight][Clear][OpenFarLeft][Clear]
[OpenLeft]
[CloseEyes][Beat][N]
Damn it all[Beat][A]
Is this truly[N]
the only way[Beat]?[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Opening_1 // Cut to castle Poblano. Introduce Baron Colome. He talks with his mother (Lorea) and son (Aquino) about Olmos' plight.
[OpenMidLeft][LoadColome][OpenRight][LoadAquino][OpenFarRight][LoadLorea]
[OpenRight]
Father[Beat][N]
This isn't enough support.[A]
Lord Narvaez has an army![N]
Olmos only has a handful of troops.[A]
Knowing the threat, you'd only[N]
give him so little?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you doubt my judgment, Aquino?[A]
[OpenRight]
I worry for my brother's safety.[N]
He is still young[A]
He is a neophyte in matters[N]
of military and diplomacy.[A]
He needs more support if[N]
you wish to have him deal with this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I will not legitimize Lord[N]
Narvaez's false claims.[A]
This must end quickly[N]
and with little fanfare.[A]
[OpenRight]
Which is why Olmos needs[N]
our full support![A]
Or even better, the leadership[N]
of someone more seasoned![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you have so little faith[N]
in your brother to handle this?[A]
He is not a child anymore, Aquino.[N]
He is a full-grown man.[A]
His report indicates as such.[N]
He achieved success in his first fight.[A]
[Beat] I have my full faith that[N]
Olmos will continue to fight and win.[A]
[OpenRight]
Father[Beat][A]
[OpenFarRight]
Surely, you can understand[N]
Aquino's concerns, Colome.[A]
Olmos may have won once,[N]
but he is still green.[A]
[OpenRight]
Grandmother, you agree with this?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
War is an ugly thing.[A]
Neither of you are old enough[N]
to remember our fight for independence.[A]
It was a brutal, bloody affair.[N][CloseEyes]
[Beat] I'd prefer not to relive this.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
I agree.[N]
I trust we will not need our full might.[A]
One need not wield a sledgehammer[N]
to strike down a fly.[A]
[OpenRight]
And yet you'd test the strength[N]
of this so-called fly with your son?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your concerns are heard,[N]
but I will not change my tact.[A]
My decision is final.[N]
Do not challenge me again.[A]
[OpenRight]
[Beat] I will go to his aid.[N]
Do not try to stop me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You will do no such thing.[N]
I have orders for you.[A]
You will stay here and manage[N]
affairs here.[A]
I have matters to tend to with[N]
Lady Sykora of House Tamarindo.[A]
[OpenRight]
You'd even leave now!?[N]
[Beat] Father.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I admire your stout heart, my son.[A]
It is this fiery passion and[N]
sense of duty that will serve you well.[A]
One day, these lands will be yours.[N]
You must learn to control these.[A]
The flames of passion are powerful,[N]
but uncontrolled they leave naught but ash.[A]
Come, I will be leaving on the morrow.[N]
We must prepare.[A]
[OpenRight]
Very well, Baron Colome[Beat][A]
[OpenFarRight]
[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter_03_Opening_2 // Group arrives on map by the entrance, explains the map objective to cleanse shrines.
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLuz][OpenMidRight][LoadOlmos]
[OpenMidLeft]
The voices are getting louder.[N]
Fear not[Beat] We will soothe you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Voices? I thought you only[N]
heard the voice of Recaudo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
There is a cacophony of voices,[N]
but Recaudo's can reach me clearly.[A]
Think of others like chatter[N]
in a town square,[A]
noise I can hear, but specific words[N]
are tough to hear clearly.[A]
[Beat] I've gathered enough to know[N]
this is the place.[A]
I see the ruins up ahead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see some movement, too.[N]
We're not alone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lord Olmos, I must cleanse the[N]
shrines and make an offering.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We'll make sure you're protected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you.[N]
I can defend myself with magic,[A]
but my aim targets are the shrines.[N]
The more shrines I can cleanse,[A]
the calmer the spirits will be.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I think I understand.[N]
Okay, let's go quickly.[A]
I'm worried we don't know[N]
how many enemies there are[Beat][A]
Let's move quickly, and double[N]
back here if it gets too risky.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Opening_3 // Boss Intro, Cano instruct Cebolla to carry out the operation, but he quietly expresses doubt.
[LoadMidLeft][LoadCebolla][LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lord Cano, there's disturbance[N]
to the south of here.[A]
It looks like the Baron's[N]
men are here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
They'd come to this place?[N]
What could've guided them?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Only Lord Narvaez knew about[N]
this operation, correct?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's right.[A]
In truth, I do not know why[N]
my father sent us here.[A]
Desecrating ancient shrines[Beat][N]
doesn't seem like something he'd want.[A]
He was never a spiritual man,[N]
but always respected those who were.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Given the situation, you'd[N]
think he'd want to consolidate troops.[A]
Prepare to make a more[Beat][N]
meaningful strike on the Baron.[A]
But forgive me, I speak out of turn.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, you're right to ask.[N]
I have similar thoughts.[A]
We're a bit undermanned, here.[N]
I will go get troops.[A]
I trust you to take care[N]
of this disturbance in the meantime.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Leave it to me.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_PostPrep_SysText
Your objective is to cleanse shrines[N]
by talking to them with Luz.[N]
Cano is gathering reinforcements[N]
and will charge you with his men.[A]
You may end the map at any time[N]
by escaping with all units near[N]
the starting point. However, you[N]
will receive rewards based on[A]
how many shrines you are able[N]
to visit. If Luz falls this chapter,[N]
you will receive a game over.[A]

## Chapter_03_Picante_Intro // Picante joins map to steal items
[LoadMidLeft][LoadPicante]
Times are getting desperate[N]
if looting these ruins is appealing[Beat][A]
Well, gotta eat somehow,[N]
and I'll be damned if[A]
they make me pick coffee cherries.[N]
I'm not meant for that kind of thing.[A]
Seems others have the same idea,[N]
are they fighting over the loot?[A]
Good time to make my moves, hm?[N]
Alright, no more talking.[A]
Move quickly,[N]
move quietly.[A]

## Chapter_03_NewUnits_Appear // Robles, Itzel, Usoa, Erlantz appear to find Olmos
[LoadLeft][LoadItzel][LoadRight][LoadUsoa][LoadFarRight][LoadErlantz]
[OpenLeft]
I hear the sounds of fighting![N]
You were right to come this way.[A]
[OpenRight]
Erlantz taking us off course[N]
seemed to work out after all.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Your humor is lost on me.[N]
Just be glad we found them.[A]
I'd like to give our steeds[N]
a rest, but we aren't so fortunate.[A]
[OpenRight]
You doubt the fruits of your labor?[N]
These are sturdy horses.[A]
They've never failed us.[N]
We rest easy tonight.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
[CloseEyes] I should've had another coffee[Beat][N][OpenEyes]
Ah, here comes Robles.[A]
[OpenLeft][Clear]
[OpenLeft][LoadRobles]
Gah[Beat][A]
Finally caught up.[N]
Where are they?[A]
[OpenRight]
I see them. Soldiers of[N]
Poblano, our mission is clear.[A]
Reinforce Lord Olmos![N]
Let us ride![A][X]

## Chapter_03_ShrineCleanse_Dialogue // Luz cleans the shrines
[LoadMidRight][LoadLuz]
[Beat] The spirits are soothed.[N]
Thank you.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Cano_Enters // Cano reinforces, cut to Olmos who says it's time to skedaddle
[LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
They're still fighting?[N]
Time for me to step in.[A]
Charge them![A][X]

## Chapter_03_Olmos_Reacts
[LoadMidRight][LoadOlmos]
They're bringing in more soldiers[Beat][N]
We should leave soon.[A]
Head for the entrance![A][X]

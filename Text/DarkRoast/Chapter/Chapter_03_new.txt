## Chapter_03_Opening_1 // Cut to castle Poblano. Introduce Baron Colome. He talks with his mother (Lorea) and son (Aquino) about Olmos' plight.
[OpenMidLeft][LoadColome][OpenRight][LoadAquino][OpenFarRight][LoadLorea]
[OpenRight]
Father[Beat][N]
This isn't enough support.[A]
Lord Narvaez has an army![N]
Olmos only has a handful of troops.[A]
Knowing the threat, you'd only[N]
give him so little?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you doubt my judgment, Aquino?[A]
[OpenRight]
I worry for my brother's safety.[N]
He is still young[A]
He is a neophyte in matters[N]
of military and diplomacy.[A]
He needs more support if[N]
you wish to have him deal with this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I will not legitimize Lord[N]
Narvaez's false claims.[A]
This must end quickly[N]
and with little fanfare.[A]
[OpenRight]
Which is why Olmos needs[N]
our full support![A]
Or even better, the leadership[N]
of someone more seasoned![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you have so little faith[N]
in your brother to handle this?[A]
He is not a child anymore, Aquino.[N]
He is a full-grown man.[A]
His report indicates as such.[N]
He achieved success in his first fight.[A]
[Beat] I have my full faith that[N]
Olmos will continue to fight and win.[A]
[OpenRight]
Father[Beat][A]
[OpenFarRight]
Surely, you can understand[N]
Aquino's concerns, Colome.[A]
Olmos may have won once,[N]
but he is still green.[A]
[OpenRight]
Grandmother, you agree with this?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
War is an ugly thing.[A]
Neither of you are old enough[N]
to remember our fight for independence.[A]
It was a brutal, bloody affair.[N][CloseEyes]
[Beat] I'd prefer not to relive this.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
I agree.[N]
I trust we will not need our full might.[A]
One need not wield a sledgehammer[N]
to strike down a fly.[A]
[OpenRight]
And yet you'd test the strength[N]
of this so-called fly with your son?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your concerns are heard,[N]
but I will not change my tact.[A]
My decision is final.[N]
Do not challenge me again.[A]
[OpenRight]
[Beat] I will go to his aid.[N]
Do not try to stop me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You will do no such thing.[N]
I have orders for you.[A]
You will stay here and manage[N]
affairs here.[A]
I have matters to tend to with[N]
Lady Sykora of House Tamarindo.[A]
[OpenRight]
You'd even leave now!?[N]
[Beat] Father.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I admire your stout heart, my son.[A]
It is this fiery passion and[N]
sense of duty that will serve you well.[A]
One day, these lands will be yours.[N]
You must learn to control these.[A]
The flames of passion are powerful,[N]
but uncontrolled they leave naught but ash.[A]
Come, I will be leaving on the morrow.[N]
We must prepare.[A]
[OpenRight]
Very well, Baron Colome[Beat][A]
[OpenFarRight]
[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter_03_Opening_2 // Group arrives on map by the entrance, explains the map objective to cleanse shrines.
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLuz][OpenMidRight][LoadOlmos]
[OpenMidLeft]
The voices are getting louder.[N]
Fear not[Beat] We will soothe you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Voices? I thought you only[N]
heard the voice of Recaudo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
There is a cacophony of voices,[N]
but Recaudo's can reach me clearly.[A]
Think of others like chatter[N]
in a town square,[A]
noise I can hear, but specific words[N]
are tough to hear clearly.[A]
[Beat] I've gathered enough to know[N]
this is the place.[A]
I see the ruins up ahead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see some movement, too.[N]
We're not alone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lord Olmos, I must cleanse the[N]
shrines and make an offering.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We'll make sure you're protected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you.[N]
I can defend myself with magic,[A]
but my aim targets are the shrines.[N]
The more shrines I can cleanse,[A]
the calmer the spirits will be.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I think I understand.[N]
Okay, let's go quickly.[A]
I'm worried we don't know[N]
how many enemies there are[Beat][A]
Let's move quickly, and double[N]
back here if it gets too risky.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Opening_3 // Boss Intro, Cano instruct Cebolla to carry out the operation, but he quietly expresses doubt.
[LoadMidLeft][LoadCebolla][LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lord Cano, there's disturbance[N]
to the south of here.[A]
It looks like the Baron's[N]
men are here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
They'd come to this place?[N]
What could've guided them?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Only Lord Narvaez knew about[N]
this operation, correct?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's right.[A]
In truth, I do not know why[N]
my father sent us here.[A]
Desecrating ancient shrines[Beat][N]
doesn't seem like something he'd want.[A]
He was never a spiritual man,[N]
but always respected those who were.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Given the situation, you'd[N]
think he'd want to consolidate troops.[A]
Prepare to make a more[Beat][N]
meaningful strike on the Baron.[A]
But forgive me, I speak out of turn.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, you're right to ask.[N]
I have similar thoughts.[A]
We're a bit undermanned, here.[N]
I will go get troops.[A]
I trust you to take care[N]
of this disturbance in the meantime.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Leave it to me.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_PostPrep_SysText
Your objective is to cleanse shrines[N]
by talking to them with Luz.[N]
Cano is gathering reinforcements[N]
and will charge you with his men.[A]
You may end the map at any time[N]
by escaping with all units near[N]
the starting point. However, you[N]
will receive rewards based on[A]
how many shrines you are able[N]
to visit. If Luz falls this chapter,[N]
you will receive a game over.[A]

## Chapter_03_Picante_Intro // Picante joins map to steal items
[LoadMidLeft][LoadPicante]
Times are getting desperate[N]
if looting these ruins is appealing[Beat][A]
Well, gotta eat somehow,[N]
and I'll be damned if[A]
they make me pick coffee cherries.[N]
I'm not meant for that kind of thing.[A]
Seems others have the same idea,[N]
are they fighting over the loot?[A]
Good time to make my moves, hm?[N]
Alright, no more talking.[A]
Move quickly,[N]
move quietly.[A]

## Chapter_03_Picante_Olmos // Recruitment
[LoadMidLeft][LoadPicante][LoadMidRight][LoadOlmos]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gah, I've been caught.[N]
It's all over for me![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hm? You don't look like[N]
one of the soldiers.[A]
Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Who are you to ask[N]
for my name?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am Lord Olmos of Poblano.[N]
May I have your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Olmos[Beat] Like the[N]
son of the Baron!?[A]
I see, I see.[N]
Well, I'm Picante.[A]
I'm something of a[N]
treasure hunter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Looks more like you're[N]
something of a thief.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's all a matter of[N]
perspective, milord![A]
Is it thievery if no[N]
one is using it?[A]
What if we uncover[N]
an ancient sword?[A]
One you could even use?[N]
Wouldn't that make it worth it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't condone taking[N]
what isn't given to me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
A true noble![N]
So noble indeed![A]
You know, I can do other[N]
things besides hunt treasure.[A]
I'm also good with[N]
picking locks.[A]
I have deft hands, milord![N]
You don't want me as an enemy.[A]
Trust me![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Are you making an offer[N]
to join us?[A]
I know we are short on[N]
troops, but[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'll work for nothing![N]
Just let me[Beat] explore.[A]
Yeah, we'll call it that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hm, very well.[N]
I'll talk to Flor about this.[A]
[OpenMidRight][Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenQuote]Who are you to ask[N]
for my name?[CloseQuote][A]
That sounded pretty good.[N]
Exuding confidence![A]
Good job, me.[N]
Well, let's hope this works out.[A]
Can't be worse than[N]
dealing with pirates.[A]
Marquez has no imagination[N]
to even think of a gig like this![A]
Maybe I'll become a spy,[N]
a peddler of secrets![A]
Now we're talking.[N]
Anyway, let's keep at it.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_NewUnits_Appear // Robles, Itzel, Usoa, Erlantz appear to find Olmos
[LoadLeft][LoadItzel][LoadRight][LoadUsoa][LoadFarRight][LoadErlantz]
[OpenLeft]
I hear the sounds of fighting![N]
You were right to come this way.[A]
[OpenRight]
Erlantz taking us off course[N]
seemed to work out after all.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Your humor is lost on me.[N]
Just be glad we found them.[A]
I'd like to give our steeds[N]
a rest, but we aren't so fortunate.[A]
[OpenRight]
You doubt the fruits of your labor?[N]
These are sturdy horses.[A]
They've never failed us.[N]
We rest easy tonight.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
[CloseEyes] I should've had another coffee[Beat][N][OpenEyes]
Ah, here comes Robles.[A]
[OpenLeft][Clear]
[OpenLeft][LoadRobles]
Gah[Beat][A]
Finally caught up.[N]
Where are they?[A]
[OpenRight]
I see them. Soldiers of[N]
Poblano, our mission is clear.[A]
Reinforce Lord Olmos![N]
Let us ride![A][X]

## Chapter_03_ShrineCleanse_Dialogue // Luz cleans the shrines
[LoadMidRight][LoadLuz]
[Beat] The spirits are soothed.[N]
Thank you.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Cano_Enters // Cano reinforces, cut to Olmos who says it's time to skedaddle
[LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
They're still fighting?[N]
Time for me to step in.[A]
Charge them![A][X]

## Chapter_03_Olmos_Reacts
[LoadMidRight][LoadOlmos]
They're bringing in more soldiers[Beat][N]
We should leave soon.[A]
Head for the entrance![A][X]

## Chapter_03_Boss_Olmos
[LoadMidRight][LoadCebolla]
So, the Baron knew we'd come here.[N]
But he sent only the second son?[A]
Does he insult the might[N]
of Lord Narvaez?[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadOlmos]
[Beat] I'll make you regret[N]
underestimating me![A][X]

## Chapter_03_Boss_Domingo
[LoadMidLeft][LoadDomingo]
Enemies of the people![N]
Defilers of the spirits![A]
Today you answer for[N]
your foul, foul crimes![A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCebolla]
Stand aside, old man. You'll[N]
be joining the spirits soon.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadDomingo]
[CloseEyes]When the time comes and[N]
I ascend to the heavens,[A]
I will be greeted by Phusrang[N]
and the Five Chela.[A]
I do not fear death.[N]
Don't treat it like a threat.[A]
Defiling statues to honor[N]
heroes and spirites[Beat][A]
It is a loathsome act.[N]
You will be judged harshly.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCebolla]
[Beat] Shut up![N]
You wouldn't understand![A]
These aren't matters of spirit.[N]
They are matters of the flesh![A]
What good are the spirits[N]
if those loyal still suffer?[A]
The Baron hoards wealth and[N]
leaves naught but crumbs for us.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadDomingo]
Does one suffer if they[N]
choose to live virtuously?[A]
Does one suffer if they[N]
free themselves of want?[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCebolla]
Want or not, the people[N]
need food. They need homes.[A]
Leaving it up to the spirits?[N]
I'll take it into my own hands.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadDomingo]
And I shall with mine.[N]
Come![A][X]

## Chapter_03_Boss_Luz
[LoadMidRight][LoadCebolla]
Ah, the spirit caller.[N]
[Beat] Leave this place.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadLuz]
It is because of your actions[N]
that I am here at all[Beat][A]
The voices of the spirits[Beat][N]
They call in pain.[A]
Do you not hear their wails?[N]
Their cries?[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCebolla]
[Beat] Don't say another word.[N]
I don't want to hear it![A][X]

## Chapter_03_Boss_Generic
[LoadMidRight][LoadCebolla]
You may not condone[N]
our actions,[A]
but it is all part[N]
of the plan.[A]
It's only the beginning[N]
of a new age for Poblano,[A]
nay, all of Tomelloso![A][X]

## Chapter_03_Cano_Olmos
[LoadMidLeft][LoadOlmos]
Cousin Cano![N]
Stop this madness.[A]
Please, let's talk![N]
I don't want to fight.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
Cousin Olmos[Beat] I hoped[N]
it wouldn't come to this.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadOlmos]
Please, what does your father[N]
want from all of this?[A]
Surely you can see his actions[N]
will weaken all of Poblano.[A]
Let us work together[N]
to resolve this![A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
[Beat] I'm sorry, cousin.[N]
Things are different now.[A]
My father's placed a great[N]
deal of trust in me[Beat][A]
I don't intend to let him down.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadOlmos]
So, you'd just blindly[N]
follow the words of your father?![A]
Think about what it is[N]
he's doing here![A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
Are you not also blindly[N]
following orders?[A]
Or have you reasoned your[N]
father is in the right?[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadOlmos]
[Beat][N]
I[Beat] Well[Beat][A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
Then we are the same.[N]
Olmos, I'm sorry.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Cano_Itzel
[LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
A young woman[Beat][N]
Please, leave this place.[A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidLeft][LoadItzel]
I should ask the same of you![N]
I won't take your pity![A]
[Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadCano]
[Beat] Then you leave me[N]
no choice. Farewell.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Ending_01 // Cano lets the group escape
[LoadMidLeft][LoadCano]
[Beat] Let them go.[N]
No need to chase further.[A]
Our cover's been blown.[N]
We retreat to the castle.[A][X]

## Chapter_03_Ending_02 // The group catches their breath, expresses concerns they've been seen by Cano. They learn the latest from Usoa and co. -- their goal is to strike down Narvaez swiftly.
[LoadLeft][LoadOlmos][LoadRight][LoadLuz][LoadFarRight][LoadDomingo][LoadFarLeft][LoadFlor]
We successfully escaped.[N]
No one followed us.[A]
They let us go.[N]
[Beat] Likely for the best.[A]
I predict they won't[N]
attack us in the village now.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Still[Beat] this does not[N]
make any sense.[A]
Why sully statues of[N]
the spirits in old ruins?[A]
I thought this was[N]
about who runs the coffee trade.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Speaking of which, it's ready.[N]
How do you like yours?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Cream and sugar for me.[A]
[OpenRight]
Black.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Black also.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Very well.[N]
Just a moment.[A]
[Clear]
[OpenLeft]
That said, we have to plan[N]
our next move.[A]
Our orders are clear.[N]
We must make for his manse.[A]
[OpenRight]
Lord Narvaez's manse is[N]
along the southerly coast.[A]
It's a few days here,[N]
assuming weather permits.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I'm surprised you know.[N]
Pardon my ignorance,[A]
but I assumed shamans[N]
didn't travel much.[A]
[OpenRight]
I grew up not far from the manse.[A]
Lord Narvaez would hold rituals[N]
to pay respects to the spirits.[A]
Phusrang, the Five Chela,[N]
Qahweh, among others[Beat][A]
In those days, he seemed[N]
to hold deep respect of the spirits.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Makes his recent actions[N]
even more difficult to parse.[A]
The ruins aren't a particularly[N]
accessible location.[A]
Building a base there[N]
would be a tactical error.[A]
Easy to surround and cut[N]
off from supplies,[A]
little natural cover,[N]
plus, well, the spirits themselves.[A]
It's an inauspicious place[N]
to sharpen blades and spill blood.[A]
[LoadFarRight][LoadDomingo]
Here you are.[N]
Be careful, it's hot.[A]
[LoadLeft]
Many thanks, Father.[N]
The color looks perfect.[A]
[LoadFarRight]
It is the blessing of Qahweh[N]
that brings us this bean.[A]
[LoadFarLeft]
We owe much to the bean.[N]
Coffee is the lifeblood of Tomelloso.[A]
[LoadLeft]
Indeed.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
That said, the road to the[N]
manse would be treacherous.[A]
I'm sure Lord Narvaez posted[N]
sentries along the road.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Taking a boat would also[N]
give us little cover.[A]
While we'd be able to[N]
disembark near the manse,[A]
we would lose any chances[N]
of surprising his troops.[A]
[OpenRight]
There is another way, but[N]
it may be dangerous.[A]
[OpenLeft]
How dangerous?[A]
[OpenRight]
The coastal caverns.[A]
The cave network extends[N]
all along the southerly coast.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Hm, but there are likely[N]
pirates there now.[A]
They're small time crooks,[N]
but it won't be an easy trip.[A]
The caverns are dark, cramped,[N]
and generally unpleasant.[A]
But, no one would[N]
expect us to take them.[A]
[OpenLeft]
It's a gamble we must[N]
be willing to take.[A]
If our goal is to[N]
strike decisively and swiftly,[A]
then it seems the best.[A]
I don't wish to fight a[N]
war of attrition in the fields.[A]
Perhaps then once we reach[N]
Lord Narvaez's manse[Beat][A]
Maybe then we can end[N]
this peacefully.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[Beat] Yes, I hope so too.[N]
Thank you, Father,[A]
for the coffee.[N]
It was brewed to perfection.[A]
I'll brief the others[N]
on our plans.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Allow me to assist.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][Clear][OpenFarRight][Clear]
[OpenRight]
Lord Olmos.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Yes, Sister Luz?[A]
[OpenRight]
[Beat] Don't push yourself too hard.[N]
I know little of war, but[Beat][A]
Don't allow yourself[N]
to be defined by it.[A]
[OpenLeft]
How do you mean?[N]
It's my duty, no?[A]
[OpenRight]
Duty is but one facet[N]
of our being, Lord Olmos.[A]
I may be the shaman blessed[N]
with the voice of Recaudo,[A]
but I am also Luz.[N]
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[Beat] I'll keep it in mind.[N]
Thank you, Sister Luz.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Opening_1 // sys text to show the Baron will support their march and send men, but to first press on.
To my son, Olmos.[A]
Thank you for your report,[N]
although I cannot say I was[N]
pleased to receive this news.[A]
It is unfortunate that my[N]
cousin would seek to destabilize[N]
our home for his own ambitions.[A]
Shameful, shameful acts![N]
Nevertheless, I entrust him[N]
to you. Bring him back alive.[A]
Supplies and soldiers will[N]
follow. I trust they'll be enough.[N]
Thank you for taking care of this.[A]
-- Baron Colome.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Opening_2 // Volquez says to go to the shrine of Recaudo. Not just for spiritual protection, but also because it is closer to Narvaez's holdings
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOlmos][OpenRight][LoadFlor][OpenFarRight][LoadVolquez]
[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat] That's all he had to say?[N]
Hardly much more than a [OpenQuote]thank you[CloseQuote][A]
[OpenRight]
[Beat] I'm sure he just wanted to provide[N]
you with instructions quickly.[A]
There's a reason he sent this[N]
without any supplies, too.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
[Beat][A]
[OpenRight]
[Beat] Remember, these are your duties.[N]
Anyway, we should continue our journey.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat] Yes, very well.[N]
What is our next stop?[A]
I see nothing but rows[N]
and rows of coffee trees.[A]
I can barely tell north[N]
from south in these parts.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
There's a small farming village[N]
that houses the shrine of Recaudo.[A]
Lord Narvaez's men may be stirring[N]
up remote villages to take arms.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Shrine of Recaudo[Beat]?[N]
I can't say I've heard of it.[A]
What sort of spirit are they?[A]
[OpenRight]
Recaudo is said to offer protection[N]
to both the weary and the faithful.[A]
During the Islands Era, when the[N]
island of Tomelloso was first settled,[A]
the story goes she protected this village[N]
from invaders from another island.[A]
She's a popular spirit in this region,[N]
where she supposedly lived and died.[A]
The farmhands in particular look to[N]
her for both solace and protection.[A]
Travelers also may make offerings[N]
to ensure safety on their treks.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I didn't know you knew so much[N]
about the history of the spirits.[A]
[OpenRight]
[Beat] I was raised not too far[N]
from these parts.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
The crops are starting to change.[N]
I see fields for cabbages.[A]
We're nearing the village.[N]
Keep on your guard.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Opening_3 // Cut to Domingo, Hwan, and Luz. Luz is captured and Domingo runs away. On map scene
[LoadMidLeft][LoadPerez][LoadRight][LoadLuz][LoadFarRight][LoadDomingo]
[OpenMidLeft]
I've made our demands clear.[N]
I'll say it once more.[A]
The townsfolk will give us[N]
the beans at a steep discount.[A]
Thirty-five percent seems like[N]
the right amount to me.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Thirty-five percent!?[N]
With all due respect,[A]
that cannot be done.[N]
Our village is a humble one.[A]
These people have little[N]
in material posessions[Beat][A]
Does Lord Narvaez truly wish[N]
to see the people he serves suffer?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You're already suffering,[N]
Father Domingo.[A]
Or are you too blinded[N]
by your overgrown eyebrows to see?[A]
We're funding a war effort.[N]
And war efforts need gold.[A]
Taking your latest crop[N]
and selling for greater profit[A]
will serve to end this rebellion[N]
swiftly in glorious revolution.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Absolute madness![N]
This will not stand![A]
[OpenRight]
Father Domingo[Beat][N]
[CloseEyes]I can hear the voices.[A]
They call out[Beat] in pain.[N]
[Beat] So sorrowful[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey![N]
Someone grab this girl![A]
I'm not letting any spirit[N]
callers interfere with this.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
You will not place a hand[N]
on Sister Luz![A]
If any harm befalls her[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Loyal as you folks may[N]
be to ghosts and shrines,[A]
I'm sure the fine folks of[N]
this village will see to reason.[A]
A little less gold for your[N]
home, your loved ones, your life[Beat][A]
That all seems much more[N]
importan than the spirits, right?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Damn you![A]
Lord Narvaez's foul aims[N]
will be met in kind![A]
[OpenRight]
Father Domingo[Beat][N]
Don't let him anger you.[A]
It's clear he made up his[N]
mind already[Beat][A]
You and Hwan need to[N]
escape[Beat] I'll be fine[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No running![N]
Get them all![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadHwan]
[OpenMidLeft]
Father Domingo![N]
Trust Sister Luz.[A]
We must escape.[N]
Now![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Brother Hwan[Beat]![N]
Very well.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Opening_2_pt2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][LoadPerez][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][LoadLuz]
Let them run.[N]
Men! To me![A]
Let's begin our[N]
operation.[A]
And destroy those blasted[N]
shrines, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Desecrating the shrines[N]
will not end well for you[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat] Don't even think about[N]
doing anything strange, shaman.[A]
Lock this one up[N]
in the store room below.[A]
[Beat] Hurry![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Opening_4 // Domingo rushes and meets Olmos at the edge of town to explain what's happened. They agree to join w/ Domingo and Hwan to rout the village. Domingo and Hwan give a brief intro
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFlor][OpenLeft][LoadOlmos]
[OpenLeft]
Something looks wrong here.[N]
What the heck is going on?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Lord Olmos, be on your guard.[N]
Look ahead![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Opening_4_pt2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOlmos][LoadRight][LoadDomingo][LoadFarRight]
[OpenRight]
Gah![N]
Do my eyes deceive me?[A]
More soldiers!?[N]
Stay back[Beat]![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Father Domingo![N]
Lower your axe![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Peace, man![N]
I don't mean you harm.[A]
What is happening here?[A]
[OpenRight]
You're not sent by Lord Narvaez?[N]
Then you must be[Beat][A]
Lord Aquino, son of Baron Colome?[N]
You've come to save us[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat] Aquino is my elder brother.[N]
I am the Baron's younger son, Olmos.[A]
[OpenRight]
Ah, right.[N]
I forgot he had two sons.[A]
Pardon my rudeness, Lord Olmos.[N]
Our village is being disturbed.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Lord Narvaez has sent men here[N]
to buy the coffee crop for cheap.[A]
We refused to comply with their[N]
demands, and they're[Beat] not happy.[A]
[OpenRight]
Speak plainly, Brother Hwan![N]
They've gone absolutely mad![A]
They took Sister Luz hostage[N]
as well, the voice of Recaudo![A]
Kidnapping our shaman and coercing[N]
the people to sell at a loss[Beat][A]
Baron Colome's always purchased[N]
the crop at a fair, market price![A]
Extorting us to fund war[Beat][N]
My blood, it boils at the thought![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
He'd stoop so low[Beat][N]
Lord Uncle, what is your aim[Beat]?[A]
[OpenRight][Clear][OpenFarRight][Clear]
[LoadMidRight][LoadFlor]
Lord Olmos.[N]
This is our chance.[A]
We must strike quickly[N]
before they know we're here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We don't even know how[N]
many there are![A]
We need more soldiers,[N]
more supplies, more-[A]
[OpenMidRight]
There are times to plan[N]
and there are times to act.[A]
Now we have the element of surprise.[N]
It'd be wise to act. Now.[A]
Lord Narvaez likely didn't send[N]
more than a token force here.[A]
Why waste resources subduing[N]
a small village like this?[A]
He'd send only the bare minimum.[N]
We can take them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm[Beat] I suppose[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I know you're still hesitant[N]
to fight your fellow Poblanans[Beat][A]
But we must not pass up[N]
these opportunities to strike back.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Fair enough.[N]
Still[Beat][A][X]

## Chapter_02_Post_Prep
[ConversationText]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDomingo]
These scoundrels will not only[N]
take the town's harvest,[A]
but also attempt to destroy[N]
our shrine of Recaudo.[A]
This shrine has stood for[N]
hundreds of years.[A]
For it to be destroyed[Beat][N]
we'd survive, but in a deep sorrow.[A]
I hope we can move swiftly[N]
enough to save it.[A]
Lord Olmos, use my axe[N]
as you see fit.[A]
Don't let appearances deceive you[Beat][N]
I'm quite a force.[A]
Hraaaaa[Beat]![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Village_Mend
[ConversationText]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadDarkHairWoman]
I was training to become a maiden[N]
of the shrine with Father Domingo,[AN]
but the pay wasn't enough.[N]
I then wanted to take up medicine,[AN]
but my family is too poor to[N]
send me to the capital for school.[AN]
I run a small coffee shop now.[N]
Locally roasted here in town.[AN]
Qahweh was kind enough to bless me[N]
with the skill of coffee brewing.[AN]
It's not easy, but we get by.[N]
Here, you're out there protecting us.[AN]
I learned this staff some time ago,[N]
but don't have much use for it now.[AN]
Take it, and may Recaudo[N]
protect you.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Village_SteelAxe
[ConversationText]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadOrangeHairMan]
I was a town guard for a few years.[N]
It beat wasting away in the coffee fields.[AN]
After a scrap with a few brigands,[N]
I hurt my back beyond repair.[AN]
Still need to make coin for the folks,[N]
so I tried learning to sew.[AN]
I've gotten pretty good at it.[N]
Can make some nice scarves, even.[AN]
No matter how beat up my body gets,[N]
I still need to work.[AN]
That's just life around these parts.[N]
Nothing comes to you for free.[AN]
I know fighting ain't easy.[N]
Here, take my old axe.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Generic
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
I'll do this myself![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Domingo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
Crazy old man![N]
Die already![A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDomingo]
Speak no more![N]
Your kind deserve no mercy![A]
I will not let you[N]
harass us any longer![A]
O Recaudo[Beat] See to it[N]
I end this madness[Beat]![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Hwan
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
A priest?[N]
Get out of the way![A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadHwan]
A cleric, actually.[A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
Semantics![N]
Get out of the way![A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Naranja
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
N-Naranja!?[N]
What are you doing here?![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadNaranja]
Hey there, Chief.[N]
You miss me?[A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidLeft]
I-I left that life behind[N]
a long time ago![A]
I'm a soldier now![N]
What are you scheming?![A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadNaranja]
I ain't scheming, Chief.[N]
Just trying to earn a living.[A]
Reminds me of someone I knew.[N]
We were just humble mercenaries.[A]
He led us for a while,[N]
but eventually[Beat][A]
He sold us out to pirates.[A]
Saved his own hide,[N]
sent his friends away in shackles.[A]
I'm sure that gold went to[N]
good use, seeing your armor now.[A]
And a soldier? Moving on up.[A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
I won't pretend what I did[N]
was right back then, Naranja.[A]
I can't expect you to forgive[N]
me for what happened.[A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadNaranja]
Who said anything about[N]
forgiveness? That's presumptuous.[A]
You just think you're owed[N]
everything, don't you?[A]
Well, maybe I can repay[N]
your kindess to me.[A][X]

## Chapter_02_Boss_Arbolito
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
W-what are you doing here?[N]
I thought[Beat] No, it can't.[A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadArbolito]
Why, Chief, what's that[N]
look on your face for?[A]
I am no spirit, nor[N]
any sort of ghost[Beat][A]
But perhaps I'm feeling[N]
mildly vengeful[Beat][A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
No, stop this![N]
I did what I had to![A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadArbolito]
Had to?[N]
Lying is a bad look, Chief.[A]
You left us to die.[N]
Sold us out to save yourself.[A]
And look at you now.[N]
Serving as a proper soldier.[A]
Just like we all wanted.[N]
Just like we all would talk about.[A]
Mercenary work was a means[N]
to an end[Beat][A]
The end being a cushy gig[N]
working for a noble house.[A]
Do you remember those[N]
times, Perez?[A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerez]
I-- Arbolito[Beat][N]
It doesn't have to[Beat][A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadArbolito]
Doesn't have to what?[N]
Be this way?[A]
You expect forgiveness[N]
for what you did?[A]
In truth, Naranja and I[N]
weren't out for vengeance.[A]
After we served our sentence,[N]
we tried to start over.[A]
It's been a tough road.[N]
I won't lie, Chief,[N]
we both cursed your name.[A]
But in time, it became[N]
a distant memory[Beat][A]
That is, until you show[N]
up here[Beat] in our way.[A]
Perez[Beat][N]
Goodbye.[A]
[Clear]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPerez]
No[Beat]![A][X]

## Chapter_02_EndEvent_01 // Map event to find Luz
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOlmos][OpenMidRight][LoadDomingo]
Sister Luz![N]
Where did they take her?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We didn't see anyone[N]
attempt to escape[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hm, perhaps[Beat][N]
Ah, this way![A][X]

## Chapter_02_EndEvent_02 // Luz intro. She says she's okay. On map.
[OpenFarLeft][LoadOlmos][OpenLeft][LoadDomingo][OpenMidRight][LoadLuz]
[OpenLeft]
Sister Luz![N]
Are you unharmed?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Father Domingo[Beat][N]
Yes[Beat] I am.[A]
Foul as they were,[N]
they did not harm me.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Bless Recaudo, our faith in[N]
her protection was not for naught[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Indeed. Nerve-wracking as it may[N]
be, her voice kept me calm.[A]
Perhaps in some way,[N]
she knew I'd be well.[A]
But Father Domingo, you are[N]
not alone. Who is behind you?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I am Lord Olmos.[N]
Second son of Baron Colome.[A]
I am glad to see you well.[N]
And you are Sister Luz, correct?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The son of the Baron?[N]
How fortuitous you were here.[A]
No wonder Recaudo seemed[N]
unfazed by these events.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Isn't Recaudo a spirit?[N]
Are you[Beat] a spirit caller?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Sister Luz was selected by[N]
Recaudo herself.[A]
She is the shaman of this shrine,[N]
blessed to hear the voice of Recaudo.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Father Domingo speaks true.[N]
It is my duty.[A]
Recaudo is a benevolent spirit,[N]
and so we honor her.[A]
The people her seek her guidance,[N]
and I dispense her wisdom.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I see[Beat][N]
Well, I am glad you are well.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Yes, we are all relieved.[N]
Come, let us rest this evening.[A]
I'm sure the townsfolk are a [N]
bit rattled after the fight.[A]

## Chapter_02_EventEvent_03 // Discussion about there being additional shrines that may be desecrated. Some lore about shamans of Tomelloso. Agree to go cleanse the shrines.
[OpenLeft][LoadFlor][OpenRight][LoadOlmos]
[OpenLeft]
Lord Olmos, you've been[N]
quiet all evening.[A]
I've known you long enough[N]
that something weighs on you.[A]
Don't keep it in.[N]
Speak freely with me.[A]
[OpenRight]
Seems I can't keep anything[N]
a secret from you.[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]I've been with you since[N]
you were a small boy.[A]
I'd not be good at what I do[N]
if I hadn't learned how to read you.[A]
[OpenRight]
I'm just glad you're on our side.[A]
I'd have no chance of success[N]
without your support.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Enough flattery.[N]
Tell me, what's wrong?[A]
Are you still feeling[N]
uneasy about the fighting?[A]
[OpenRight]
We'll be facing my uncle soon.[N]
I[Beat] I don't know, Flor.[A]
I struggle to comprehend[N]
why he'd take such action.[A]
Poblano[Beat] The people[Beat][N]
they're fine, right?[A]
They aren't suffering under[N]
tyranny, right?[A]
My father is a good ruler,[N]
worthy of respect, right?[A]
I always thought Poblano[N]
to be a prosperous land.[A]
One of the strongest[N]
territories on the island[Beat][A]
[OpenLeft]
[Beat] There will always be those[N]
dissatisfied by those who rule.[A]
Baron Colome is a good man.[N]
That is why I serve him.[A]
He gave me an opportunity,[N]
and I pay back with loyalty.[A]
Your uncle is motivated by[N]
his own ambitions, Lord Olmos.[A]
He envies your father,[N]
and seeks to take his place.[A]
Anything else you may hear[N]
is to distract you from the truth.[A]
[OpenRight]
But others wish to support him.[N]
That is what I don't understand.[A]
If my father were as great[N]
as you say[Beat][A]
Would all not come to his defense?[N]
It means something is not right.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Much like your uncle,[N]
who wishes to take the throne,[A]
others too stand to benefit[N]
from a changing order.[A]
There will always be those[N]
who seek to disrupt order.[A]
Especially when they stand to[N]
benefit from it.[A]
All you can do is do what you[N]
feel is virtuous, Lord Olmos.[A]
Live virtuously, focus on[N]
what you can control[Beat][A]
It is through these truths[N]
that you may achieve your goals.[A]
[OpenRight]
You make it sound so simple.[N]
And yet[Beat][A]
[OpenLeft]
Don't overthink things.[N]
You have a duty, Lord Olmos.[A]
If you wish for Poblano to[N]
thrive, you must oust its threats.[A]
That means Lord Narvaez[N]
must fall. That's all.[A]
[OpenRight]
[Beat] I see.[A]
[LoadFarRight][LoadDomingo][LoadFarLeft][LoadLuz]
[OpenFarRight]
Lord Olmos![N]
I trust we are not interrupting.[A]
[OpenRight]
Good evening, Father Domingo.[N]
[Beat] No, not at all.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Sister Luz heard the voices[N]
of the spirits once more[Beat][A]
We'd like to make[N]
a request of you and your group.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
There are shrines to the north[N]
that are being disturbed.[A]
I can only hear their wails[Beat][N]
They call out in pain.[A]
They wish only to rest,[N]
but[Beat] they cannot.[A]
[OpenLeft]
The south of this village[N]
is fairly remote.[A]
There are old ruins there,[N]
from the earliest settlements[Beat][A]
[OpenRight]
Why would anyone disturb[N]
these ancient ruins?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
I do not know the answer,[N]
but the spirits call in pain.[A]
I worry what the aim is[N]
of those who disturb the old spirits.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'd march right up there[N]
now if I could[Beat][A]
Please, Lord Olmos[Beat][N]
We humbly ask for your support.[A]
[OpenRight]
This place is not too far, correct?[N]
Let us ride in the morning.[A]
[OpenLeft]
[Beat] Are you certain, Lord Olmos?[A]
[OpenRight]
It is as you said.[N]
I must act with virtue.[A]
How can I sit idly by[N]
when our people suffer?[A]
Father Domingo, Sister Luz[Beat][N]
we will assist.[A]
Let us rest, then tomorrow[N]
we ride at dawn.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Your kindness is boundless.[N]
Thank you, Lord Olmos.[A]
I only hope whatever we uncover[Beat][N]
will not lead us to ruin[Beat][A][X]
